# Graphic Computer Work in 3D
This work is for Graphic Computer discipline for Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo in 2014/2.

It's a game where you control a tank in a maze (as an PNG image) and you shoot other tanks without taking a single hit.

You can change the speed of the tank and cannon ball speed by changing the parameter tankSpeed and shootSpeed, respectively in the config.xml file.
