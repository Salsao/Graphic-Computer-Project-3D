# Graphic Computer Project in 3D
This project is for Graphic Computer discipline for Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo in 2014/2.

It's a game where you control a tank in a maze (as an PNG image) and you shoot other tanks without taking three hits.

Video demonstrating: https://youtu.be/en5boq6k8II

You can change the speed of the tank and cannon ball speed by changing the parameter tankSpeed and shootSpeed, respectively in the config.xml file.
